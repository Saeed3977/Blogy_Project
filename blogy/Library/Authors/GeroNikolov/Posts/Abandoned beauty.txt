This Renaissance Fair was opened in 1996 and found itself in financial trouble from the start. Throw in lots of bad weather, swamp land, and swarms of mosquito and you getâ€¦ a recipe for failure. After only three years in operation, the Renaissance Fair went belly up.  What was interesting about exploring the fair was the backstage glimpse in to how fake the whole production really was. Today the surrounding forest slowly consumes the cheap wooden structures representing medieval Europe.
