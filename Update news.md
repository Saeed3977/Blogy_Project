<b>Update: 07.03</b><br>
<b>*1.Perfect design and scaling on the different devices.</b><br>
	-We redesigned some parts that were "bugging" and now everything is ok.<br>
<b>*2.Stories builder</b><br>
	-In the process if testing the platform we experienced the problem of "slow loading".<br>
	So we decided to include SQL database instead of using File I/O and try to see which is faster.<br>
	-We still store information about posts into .txt files on the server. (We use this to make sure backup structure.)<br>
<b>*3.Messaging system</b><br>
	-We translate the idea and we decided that we don't need to make special chat room because with the current design of the messages, you just won't spent more time waiting for answer, so we leave it
	the way it was and we <b>introduce the quick message option</b>.<br>
	We believe in that you will feel the real experience only if you try <b>Blogy</b> all by yourself.
